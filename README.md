 Just a random, friendly Internet nerd who is enthusiastic about all things tech. 
 
 I'm interested in video game development/modding, software development, mobile & web development, cybersecurity, and generative AI (who isn't? :P). 
 
 I mainly enjoy assisting others, testing early versions of software and video games, discovering bugs and solutions, and encouraging strong privacy and security habits when online. 
 
 Despite being "tech-savvy" and using software and computer products for over twenty years, I don't yet have any notable creations of my own. Inspired by others who've accomplished so many great things and having access to amazing, powerful modern tools thanks to the efforts of other geniuses and the open-source community, I've become motivated to pursue personal projects to give back to the world—and simply because creating can be fun.

I believe in learning a little bit about everything. Currently, I have the best understanding of JavaScript, Python, Java, Kotlin, Swift, and a bit of C#, in no particular order. However, there is still much to learn, and I’d also like to tackle Rust.
